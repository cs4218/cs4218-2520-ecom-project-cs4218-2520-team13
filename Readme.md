## Running Tests

**Prerequisites:** Node.js installed, dependencies installed (`npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..`).

```bash
# Unit tests (backend + frontend)
npm test

# Backend unit + integration tests only
npm run test:backend

# Frontend unit + integration tests only
npm run test:frontend

# Backend integration tests only
npm run test:integration:backend

# Frontend integration tests only
npm run test:integration:frontend

# E2E tests (requires MongoDB + app running: npm run dev)
npm run test:e2e
```

For E2E, start MongoDB first (`brew services start mongodb-community` on Mac), then `npm run dev`, then run `npm run test:e2e` in a separate terminal.

## AI Usage declaration

Priyansh - **AI tools were used for initial user stories, followed by initial test scaffolding and code autocompletion. All AI-suggested code served only as a baseline. I manually reviewed, edited, fixed and validated the approach, code and strategy to ensure full alignment with the project requirements. (as described in AI driven testing plan)**


Wei Sheng - **AI tools were used for user story generation, initial test scaffolding (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), code autocompletion, and bug identification. All AI-suggested code served only as a baseline. I manually reviewed and validated that the AI-generated test user stories had sufficient scope to cover all relevant scenarios, and edited, fixed and validated the approach, code and strategy to ensure full alignment with the project requirements.**

Aashim - **I utilized AI to draft the initial user stories and test structures, treating its output  as a starting point. I then manually refined, corrected, and validated all code and strategies to guarantee they met the project's exact specifications.**

LOU YING WEN - **I utilized AI for drafting user stories, initial test frameworks, and code suggestions. Treating these outputs as a foundation, I personally overhauled and verified the implementation to ensure the testing approach and final code strictly conformed to our project objectives.**

Lim Yik Seng - **I utilized AI for initial test planning, drafting user stories, and generating baseline test scaffolding. However, no AI-generated code was blindly trusted. I manually audited, heavily edited, and verified all test logic, mock behaviors, and non-functional requirements to ensure the final implementation accurately reflected real-world edge cases and project requirements.**
